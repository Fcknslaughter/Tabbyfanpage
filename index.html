        <p>Tabbies Are Affectionate and Intelligent
          These unique creatures are incredibly affectionate and intelligent. They love cuddles and a whole lot of attention. However, tabbies can get pretty cranky if they don't get their way; since as a rule they are very bright, they usually end
          up getting what they want.</p>

<div class=""><h4 style="text-align: center;">Although similar, those markings are always unique</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;">
  I’m sure you’ve been online and seen a photo of another tabby cat and thought to yourself how eerily similar it looks to your own tabby. But did you know that all those markings are truly unique to each cat? Yep, that’s right! Each swirl, mackerel marking, stripe, or ticked coat piece of fur is truly unique to each tabby cat. Of course, they can be similar, obviously. But it is scientifically impossible that no two can ever be truly identical. Pretty cool, huh?!

Even more interesting is that tabby cats have a unique pigment found in each hair shaft. If you were to look closely, you will see bands of dark and light on each individual hair. There are three specific genes in a cat’s DNA that will result in a tabby coat pattern: Agouti Signaling Protein (ASIP), Mc1R, and Taqpep.

<div class=""><h4 style="text-align: center;">Tabbies are not a breed. They're much more</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;">
  A tabby cat can come in many forms. From purebreds to mixed-breed domesticated felines, there are a great number of cat breeds that can result in tabby cat markings. The Maine Coon, Manx, British Shorthair, American Bobtail, and the  Oriental Shorthair are just a few of the many cat breeds which can produce a tabby.

  While we know that ginger tabbies are predominantly male, since the ginger gene also controls the gender, other tabby cats are equally male to female when they aren’t reddish-orange in coat color.
</p></div>
<div class=""><h4 style="text-align: center;">Although domesticated, these cats were born to be wild</h4>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
  If your baby tabby tiger in your living room ever reminds you of a tiger in the wild, there’s a good reason for it. Science tells us that although they are removed and domesticated, our feline friends share about 96% of the same DNA as a tiger in the wild.

  But aside from this, we know that our cats were once wild. And those superb stripes of theirs? Well, those serve as perfect camouflage in the wild during hunts for food! These camouflage cats make great hunters, as they can easily blend in with their surroundings as they hunt prey. In fact, many of their big cat cousins in the wild have these markings for the very same purpose.
